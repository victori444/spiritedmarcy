	  <p class="timeline-text">During the month of April, each team of Yunas was hard at work. The beginning of the pandemic wasn’t going to stop us from getting things done!

		</p>
	  <p class="timeline-text">To begin the construction, the Yunas started working on the tutorial. By doing so, they wrote the script and translated it to be written in English and in French. Additionally, they organized the 3D designs by deciding when they would appear for the animation to be clear. Our programming Yunas met weekly to practice the problems that were given to them for the competition.

	  <p class="timeline-text">As for the website Yunas, the brainstorming and organization of the website was the main event that took place in that time. In summer, the journalism team planned out the website’s configuration, and the design team began their journey learning the coding languages such as HTML, javascript and CSS.

		<br> Besides, during the month of April and summer, the Yunas responsible for the video got the ball running by scripting their desired scenes. Furthermore, the 3D Yunas began their work with the help of Inventor and learned how to animate objects.
	</p>
	  <p class="timeline-text">The month of November was set with the competition CRC Invicta being announced. The Yunas established their plan meticulously devised since the unfortunate arrival of Yubaba.<br><br>
		The Yunas in charge of the website began its configuration. Perfecting the website is crucial due to it being our main source information dispensing and sharing! In mid-November, codes were finally accumulating to assure the website’s construction. Page by page, the website was, at last, gradually taking form!

		</p>
	  <p class="timeline-text">The Yunas managing the 3D modelling worked on the tutorial’s conception. They finalized the first version of the video; however, changes were made in order to refine the imperfections. Because of their advanced schedules, they helped other Yunas in need, for instance, by drawing the competition field. 
		
	</p>
	  <p class="timeline-text"> As the days got shorter, December came with a more challenging workload. Inching away from the D-day, the Yunas did not surrender and worked their fingers to the bone!

		<br>The tutorial turned into a longer task than expected, however, the Yunas willing to push through, with the intentions of enhancing it.
	</p>
	<p class="timeline-text">The new team of Yunas finally started their part by writing the script for the video. It is important that the video is filmed well because it will serve to explain the situation to the Yunas who have lost their memory. As December came to an end, they began to write the script ensuring that important details were not overlooked. One of their biggest challenges was taking care of the video, in addition to their respective tasks which was managing the website.

	</p>
	<p class="timeline-text">In early December, CRC contacted us to explain how to improve and organize the website. Following this meeting, they continued the construction of each page. The Yuna journalists collected the content and wrote the texts. The layout of the website has continued to evolve, finally arriving in its final form in late December. Their biggest challenge was distributing the tasks and the time allotted to ensure the completion of the website. The journalists handled the configuration and contents while the encoders continued to learn new codes to make sure each page was well built. They had to guarantee every task was done right to ensure that they followed the plan to defeat Yubaba.

	</p>
	<p class="timeline-text">On the 18th of January, the Yunas were informed that the competition was pushed up to April. The event will take place on the 15th of April and will end on the 17th. Two  additional months were added to perfect everything in plan. </p>
	<p class="timeline-text">In the span of two months, interviews took place and adding subtitles to the videos were taking longer than expected.  In addition, the website&lsquo;s structure was nearly achieved.

		<br>The drawings and animations of the robots and fields were completed and the tutorial is ready to go.
		<br><br>With the due date coming close, the video&lsquo;s last finishing touches were added and the last scene is completed. 
		<br><br>The website was refined and ready to go.
