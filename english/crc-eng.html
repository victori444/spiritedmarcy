  <section>Employees at the Bathhouse have been working in harmony and peace for several years under the great supervision of our director. Suddenly, Yubaba, an evil spirit, decided to terrorize the spirit realm and took over the bathhouse. This dreadful witch has been brainwashing and stealing knowledge from all the workers of the bathhouse. Without the exception of all our money and good, of course! Everything... gone!

  <section>A group of workers managed to escape the bathhouse, they call themselves the CRC Robotics. This team came in hand and provided us Invicta. It is a prototyped robot that will help us gain back all of the knowledge we have lost.

	  <br>After escaping from Yubaba’s grip, The CRC Robotics started holding, annual, competitions for the past decade. They wanted to give the chance for others to experience and join the world of science and engineering. CRC has been around for many years. Their non-profit organization has been hosting annual robotics competitions for students around the nation. CRC has not only evolved itself over the years but has helped many students as well. The competition has allowed students to explore various fields, for instance, the construction of a robot, programming, 3D design, the creation of a website and video and building a kiosk.

  <section>Having the experience of creating games, the CRC Robotics has set up one that will help us gain back our knowledge. The goal of this game is to accumulate knowledge which is achieved by winning the most points. <br><br>It is done by the following:
	<br>
	<div>
	  <span class="list-item">1</span> With a given time of 5 minutes, build structures selected at the start of the game. They are built with the help of designated pieces placed in their appointed location. 
	</div>
	<div>
	  <span class="list-item">2</span> Each structure's points are accorded to its difficulty.  The more points given per structure, the more difficult it will be to assemble.
	</div><br>
	<video width="90%" controls>

	</video><br>
	<div>
	  <span class="list-item">3</span> Once the structure has been completed, the ball located in the initial zone will need to be placed in the hoop situated in the corner of the field. As soon as the ball is placed in the hoop, modifying the structure is prohibited. The ball serves as a point multiplier.
	</div>
	<aside style = "position:absolute; left:83%; top: 3200px; z-index: -1">
		<img class="haku" src="../tokens/haku1.PNG" height="220px" alt="haku token">
	</aside>
	<div>
		<span class="list-item"> 4</span> If the structure collapses following the ball’s placement in the hoop, no bonus points will be awarded. The final score is counted according to the pieces that are still standing.
